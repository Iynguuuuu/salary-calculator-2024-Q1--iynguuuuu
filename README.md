This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To install node modules - npm i <br/>
To run the development server - npm run dev


I've used Next.js with **shadcn** and **Tailwind CSS** for UI design. 
<br/> For state management, I used **Zustand** because it was easy to work with. 
<br/> For form validation, I used **Zod**.

I encountered an issue with the checkbox validation for EPF/ETF. Otherwise, the calculation works perfectly fine.
